**N.B.** We generated the climate data using the ClimateEU software package (v. 4.63, available at http://tinyurl.com/ClimateEU), based on methodology described by Wang et al. (2016).
"Historical data since 1901-2009 are based on the CRU-TS 3.1 dataset (Mitchell & Jones, 2005, Int J Climatol 25: 693-712) and has been updated to 2013 with CRU-TS 3.22." There is likely to be uncertainty with the projections of historical temperature pre-1950, therefore the climate values shown in the paper should be considered in light of this information.
